Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Bristol with a practical, hands-on approach to design, simulation, and manufacturing. Through both academic projects and recent industrial experience at Estarli, an electric bike manufacturer, I’ve developed a strong foundation in CAD, product assembly analysis, and problem-solving in fast-paced environments. I’m eager to apply these skills in technical or design engineering roles where I can grow, contribute to real-world outcomes, and collaborate effectively with others.
